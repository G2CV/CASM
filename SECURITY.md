# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public GitHub issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

- Email: `security@g2cv.com`
- Fallback: `contact@g2cv.com`
- Include: affected version, environment, reproduction steps, impact, and any proof-of-concept

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days.

## Coordinated Disclosure

- We will validate the report and keep you informed during triage.
- If confirmed, we will coordinate a fix and release.
- We ask reporters to avoid public disclosure until a fix is available or a coordinated timeline is agreed.

Thank you for helping keep CASM users safe.
