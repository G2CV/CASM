# Wordlists

These wordlists are used for DNS enumeration. Each line contains a single subdomain label.

## Files

- `common-subdomains.txt`: 100 frequently used subdomains for quick scans.
- `extended-subdomains.txt`: 1000 entries for broader coverage.

## Custom Wordlists

Provide your own wordlist with one label per line. Comments start with `#`.

Example:

```
api
staging
dev
```
